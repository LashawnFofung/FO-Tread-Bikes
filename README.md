<h2>MBA Capstone Simulation (Conscious Capitalism)</h2>

This repository showcases the strategic analysis and decision-making undertaken for the FO Tread Bikes MBA Capstone Simulation. It details our journey in navigating a competitive bicycle manufacturing market, demonstrating hands-on experience in strategic leadership, financial management, operations, marketing, and human resources. The project highlights how data-driven decisions, particularly in supply and demand forecasting, manufacturing capacity, advertising, and pioneering product innovation (3D-printed carbon fiber technology), were crucial in achieving sustainable market share growth and optimized financial performance, culminating in a significant company valuation and a 127.68% ROI. This work exemplifies the application of Conscious Capitalism principles in a practical business context.

Through the MBA Capstone Simulation, I gained hands-on experience in strategic leadership and business strategy, encompassing strategic planning and execution, market analysis, and competitive intelligence. I honed my financial management abilities, including financial analysis, strategic investment, and P&L management. My role also involved operations management, such as supply chain management and process optimization, alongside crucial marketing and sales efforts like product marketing and sales channel optimization. A strong emphasis was placed on data analysis and decision-making, utilizing data interpretation and KPI tracking to inform data-driven strategies. Beyond technical skills, I developed essential soft skills, including critical thinking and problem-solving, strategic agility, executive presentation, cross-functional collaboration, and adaptive strategy development in response to market changes.
