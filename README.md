MBA Capstone Simulation (Conscious Capitalism)

Through the MBA Capstone Simulation, I gained hands-on experience in strategic leadership and business strategy, including strategic planning and execution, market analysis, and competitive intelligence. I honed my financial management abilities, encompassing financial analysis, strategic investment, and P&L management. My role also involved operations management, such as supply chain management and process optimization, alongside crucial marketing and sales efforts like product marketing and sales channel optimization. A strong emphasis was placed on data analysis and decision-making, utilizing data interpretation and KPI tracking to inform data-driven decisions. Beyond technical skills, I developed essential soft skills, including critical thinking and problem-solving, strategic agility, executive presentation and cross-functional collaboration, and adaptive strategy development in response to market changes.
