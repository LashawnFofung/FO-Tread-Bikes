<h3>Inventory Position</h3>

Inventory Position refers to the relationship between the number of units a company produces and the actual market demand for those units. It helps identify if production is effectively meeting customer needs or if there are surpluses or shortfalls.

For FO Tread Bikes, the analysis reveals a significant and growing challenge in their inventory position from Q4 to Q6. While production increased, it consistently lagged behind a rapidly expanding market demand. Specifically, in Q5, there was a shortfall of 2,237 units, which escalated to a massive 4,882 units in Q6. This indicates that FO Tread Bikes was unable to produce enough units to meet the strong market demand, leading to substantial missed sales opportunities.


<b>Inventory Position: Units Produced vs. Net Demand</b>

This bar chart, titled "Units Produced vs Net Demand Q2 - Q6," visually compares the total Units Produced by FO Tread Bikes against the Net Demand for its products across Quarters 2 through 6. It clearly illustrates a growing discrepancy between the company's production output and the escalating market demand, particularly from Quarter 5 onwards, indicating significant missed sales opportunities due to capacity limitations.
