<h1>Financial Performance</h1>

  - <b>Profitability:</b> Net profit/Loss Over Time
    -   <b>Objective:</b> To assess the company's financial success and efficiency in generating earnings over specific periods.
    -   <b>Value Source:</b> Income Statement
    -   <b>Metric:</b> Net Income (or Net Profit, Net Earnings)
    -   <b>Formula:</b> Net Income = Total Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold - Operating Expenses - Interest Expense - Taxes
    -   <b>Data Analysis & Visualization (Microsoft Excel):</b> Net income figures were extracted directly from the Income Statement for each quarter and analyzed to identify trends. This data was then visualized using a line graph in Microsoft Excel, illustrating net income tracked quarter-over-quarter. This allowed for a clear observation of profitability trends and facilitated the evaluation of the direct impact of strategic decisions on the company's financial bottom line.
    -   <b>Application:</b> This metric is tracked quarter-over-quarter (e.g., Q4 Net Income, Q5 Net Income, Q6 Net Income) to observe trends in profitability and evaluate the impact of strategic decisions on the bottom line.

  - <b>Revenue:</b> Total sales revenue by quarter.
    - <b>Objective:</b> To track and analyze the company's total sales generation over time.
    - <b>Value Source:</b> Income Statement (for total sales revenue).

    - <b>Formula:</b> Total Sales Revenue = (Units Sold of Recreation Bikes * Price per Recreation Bike) + (Units Sold of Speed Bikes * Price per Speed Bike) + (Units Sold of Mountain Bikes * Price per Mountain Bike)
    - <b>Note:</b> While the total sales revenue is derived from the sum of sales across segments, the Income Statement will typically show this as a single line item for 'Total Revenue' or 'Sales Revenue' per quarter.
    - <b>Data Analysis & Visualization (Microsoft Excel):</b> Total sales revenue figures were extracted directly from the Income Statement for each quarter. This data was then visualized using a bar chart in Microsoft Excel, illustrating total sales revenue tracked quarter-over-quarter. This allowed for a clear observation of overall revenue trends and growth over time, and facilitated the evaluation of the effectiveness of broader sales strategies.
    - <b>Application:</b> This metric is crucial for understanding the overall top-line growth of the company and evaluating the effectiveness of our sales and market penetration efforts across periods.
    - [<b>Revenue Visualization</b>](https://github.com/LashawnFofung/FO-Tread-Bikes/blob/main/Dashboard/Dashboards/Financial%20Performance.md#revenue)

    - <b>Objective:</b> To monitor capital allocation across a key strategic area (R&D). 
    - <b>Value Source:</b> Income Statement (for R&D) 
    - <b>Metrics & Formulas:</b> Total Investment in R&D = Sum of R&D Expense (from Income Statement for each quarter) 
    - <b>Data Analysis & Visualization (Microsoft Excel):</b> R&D expense figures were extracted from the Income Statement for each quarter. This data was then visualized using a line chart in Microsoft Excel, illustrating R&D investment tracked quarter-over-quarter. This allowed for a clear observation of investment trends in innovation and facilitated the evaluation of resource allocation towards future product development. 
    - <b>Application:</b> This section is critical for stakeholders to understand how capital is being deployed to drive growth, innovation, and operational efficiency, and to assess the ultimate financial returns generated by these strategic investments.
