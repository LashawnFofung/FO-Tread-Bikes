<h1>Financial Performance</h1>

  - <b>Profitability:</b> Net profit/Loss Over Time
    -   <b>Objective:</b> To assess the company's financial success and efficiency in generating earnings over specific periods.
    -   <b>Value Source:</b> Income Statement
    -   <b>Metric:</b> Net Income (or Net Profit, Net Earnings)
    -   <b>Formula:</b> Net Income = Total Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold - Operating Expenses - Interest Expense - Taxes
    -   <b>Data Analysis & Visualization (Microsoft Excel):</b> Net income figures were extracted directly from the Income Statement for each quarter and analyzed to identify trends. This data was then visualized using a bar chart in Microsoft Excel, illustrating net income tracked quarter-over-quarter. This allowed for a clear observation of profitability trends and facilitated the evaluation of the direct impact of strategic decisions on the company's financial bottom line.
    -   <b>Application:</b> This metric is tracked quarter-over-quarter (e.g., Q4 Net Income, Q5 Net Income, Q6 Net Income) to observe trends in profitability and evaluate the impact of strategic decisions on the bottom line.
  - <b>Revenue:</b> Total sales revenue by quarter, broken down by bike segment (Recreation, Speed, Mountain) and specific bike models (e.g., Mountain 3, CF Vector 3).
  - <b>Cash Flow:</b> Beginning and ending cash balances, and cash flow from operating, investing, and financing activities.
  - <b>Investment & ROI:</b> Tracking of initial investment, total investment in R&D, production capacity, advertising, and the projected Return on Investment (ROI).
  - <b>Cost Analysis:</b> Average unit production cost, total production cost, and expenses related to advertising, sales force, and human resources.
